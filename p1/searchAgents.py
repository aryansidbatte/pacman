    Returns the start state (in your search space,

    Your heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem goes here.

    This heuristic must be consistent to ensure correctness.
    First, try to come up with an admissible heuristic;

    If using A* ever finds a solution that is worse than what uniform cost search finds,
    your heuristic is *not* consistent, and probably not admissible!
    On the other hand, inadmissible or inconsistent heuristics may find optimal solutions,
    so be careful.

    `pacai.core.grid.Grid` of either True or False.
    You can call `foodGrid.asList()` to get a list of food coordinates instead.

    If you want access to info like walls, capsules, etc., you can query the problem.
    For example, `problem.walls` gives you a Grid of where the walls are.

    If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the heuristic,
    there is a dictionary called problem.heuristicInfo that you can use.
    For example, if you only want to count the walls once and store that value, try:
